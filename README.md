## Introduction 
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.
### Problem Statement
Danny wants some insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

## Skills showcased
- **Data Wrangling and Preparation**
	- Created and managed relational database schemas.
	- Performed joins, data cleaning, and preparation to integrate the <code>sales</code>, <code>menu</code>, and <code>members</code> datasets.
- **Analytical Problem-Solving**
	- Addressed 10 business-critical questions, translating Danny‚Äôs business challenges into SQL-based solutions.
	- Delivered actionable insights to improve customer engagement and loyalty strategies.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**
	- Utilized CTEs to break down queries into simpler, more manageable tasks.
	- Applied window functions (DENSE_RANK, RANK) to analyze customer purchasing trends and loyalty behaviors.
	- Designed conditional logic with CASE statements for customized calculations like loyalty points allocation.
- **Data Visualization and Interpretation**
	- Structured results in readable formats to support decision-making.
	- Summarized and presented key findings in a business-friendly manner for stakeholders.
- **Customer Behavior Analytics**
	- Analyzed customer purchase patterns, frequency, and spending before and after joining the loyalty program.
	- Offered insights to optimize the loyalty program, including points calculation and item popularity ranking.

## Dataset Overview
Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
- <code>sales</code>
- <code>menu</code>

		SQL Query
	</summary>

```SQL

SELECT sales.customer_id, order_date, product_name, price,

*Bonus Question #2*
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
<details>
	<summary>
		SQL Query
	</summary>

```SQL

WITH clients_table AS 
	(
	SELECT sales.customer_id, order_date, product_name, price,

		WHEN join_date <= order_date THEN 'Y'
		ELSE 'N' END AS member
   	FROM dannys_diner.sales
	JOIN dannys_diner.menu
    		ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
	LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members
      		ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
)

SELECT *, 
	CASE
	WHEN member = 'N' then NULL
	ELSE
    	RANK () OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, member
    	ORDER BY order_date) END AS ranking
FROM clients_table;

```
